# SHOW ME THE WAY TO GO HOME
A model that imitates how drunks stagger around at night from a pub to their respective homes.There are 25 drunks at one pub,that need to locate their correct numbered houses,the houses are 25 in total. The model thus first of all reads the "drunk plan" file which contains all the variables used in the model.Secondly,the model draws houses on edges of the environment and a  pub which is located in the centre.Later on, the drunks are added or called at the pub. Each drunk is allocated a house number which they must trace inorder to get home. The x and y starting point of the drunks is the pub and each of them have a specific coordinate for their houses.
