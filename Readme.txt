# ABOUT THE MODEL
There are 2 classes of the python program; independent.py and agentframework.py. To run the model, use spyder 3.7 version. 
The model starts by initializing the agentframework(class), then the "drunk.plan.txt" file is read. The file is initiated 
by introducing the variables;drunks,houses and pubs to their environment. The houses are allocated a label
which is attached to the drunks.

The pubs and homes are drawn on screen, and a scatter plot of the drunks is plotted. The drunks are assigned a starting
coordinate which is the pub. To allow the drunks wander in the environment, the drunks are then allowed to move and trace 
their specific homes. The plotted environment indicates that all drunks except one remain at the pub which is something 
that needs to be sorted.
The density map for the model was not produced
