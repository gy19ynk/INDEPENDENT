# ABOUT THE MODEL
There are 2 classes of the python program; independent.py and agentframework.py. To run the model, use spyder 3.7 version. The model starts by initializing the agentframework(class), then the "drunk.plan.txt" file is read. The file is initiated so that by introducing the drunks to their environment.

The pubs and homes are drawn on screen, and a scatter plot of the drunks is plotted. The drunks are assigned a starting coordinate which is the pub. To allow the drunks wander in the environment, the drunks are then allowed to move and trace their specific homes. The plotted environment indicates that all drunks except one remain at the pub which is something that needs to be sorted.
